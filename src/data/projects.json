        "summary": "This project explores scalable machine learning methods for classifying e-commerce product titles into 248 categories using a dataset of over 1.4 million entries. I implemented a preprocessing pipeline with TF-IDF vectorization, stopword removal, normalization, and feature selection to the top 10,000 tokens. I evaluated multiple classifiers, including Linear SVC, Logistic Regression, and Multinomial Naive Bayes, with class-weighted adjustments to handle imbalance. The study showed that Linear SVC consistently performed best on large-scale product categorization tasks, demonstrating the viability of ML for text classification in e-commerce systems.",

I led a team of two in building a system that uses Gemini for image sentiment analysis, the Spotify API for mood-aligned song selection, and Pinata for decentralized image storage. The app supports user authentication via Auth0 and stores user data in MongoDB. I designed the system architecture, handled API integration, and built the landing and core app frontend. Users can create and share playlists, with built-in group collaboration features that support co-curated music discovery.",
