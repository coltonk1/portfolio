I led a team of two in building a system that uses Gemini for image sentiment analysis, the Spotify API for mood-aligned song selection, and Pinata for decentralized image storage. The app supports user authentication via Auth0 and stores user data in MongoDB. I designed the system architecture, handled API integration, and built the landing and core app frontend. Users can create and share playlists, with built-in group collaboration features that support co-curated music discovery.",
